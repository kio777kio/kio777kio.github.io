    <h2>Music</h2>



    <p>In music we learned about solfedge, Letter notes, saome songs, and a few 
        pentatonic scales.We learned about every note (except for Fa and Ti)
        and the sign for each note and where go depending on where the La and
        Do are.We've had a few games and we have done a lot of songs where we 
        sing the solfedge the letter notes and we play it on the xylophone.
        The xylophone is the best part of music class because it is fun to do different 
        xylophones.The two main different xylophones are mettalophone and 
        xylophone.Xylophone means sound of wood in greek so that is why this instrument 
        is named xylophone.Mettalophones are different because they make their 
        sounds come out because of their metal.Music classes are quite fun
        and they are more intruiguing everyday.

    <h2>P.E</h2>
    
    

    <p>P.E stands for physical education.That means we are sweating so much during P.E. 
       Since P.E is so fun, I dont care about sweating or anything like that.We get hurt
       the most in P.E so that's the time we have to be most careful.
       In P.E we are usually in the big gym to play games. Most often 3P and 3B
       will play a big game together. My favorite game is Double Jedi because I'm 
       good at it. I think everyone loves double jedi even if their good or bad.
       P.E is definitely my favorite subject.

    <h2>Art</h2>
    
    

    <p>In Art class we have it on Wednesday and we use many different types of materials.
        In our first project Geometric shapes,we used water colors to color our shapes!
        In our second project Perspective Aquarium we learned how to make a drawing look like
        it's far away or close by making a vanishing point.We made our sea animals fit because we
        made it smaller as it became farther. After that project we did a few very small projects like
        coloring,and drawing fish and doing artwork inspired by Karla Gerard but our biggest project 
        was making the paper mach√® robot. When we made that we used recycling cardboard to make 
        the shape then we covered it in newspaper to stick everything together to get the 
        general shape. Then we covered everything in white paper and colored it and me or my partner 
        would bring it home. In Art we always have lots of fun so it is definitely a subject 
        I enjoy.

    <p>In library the main thing we do is find books that we want to read at home,check them
        out and read them at home.After we do that we used to do a special thing after like
        make robots out of the robotics lego kit,watch Totoro and much more.The librarians 
        this year are Ms.Alvadrez and Ms.Noyes.Also Ms.Fujii helps out a lot in the library
        too!Library is great because of all the amazing books there are and we enjoy 
        every minute of library.
