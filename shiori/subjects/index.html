   <h2>IPC</h2>

    <p>Our IPC units are always fun.IPC is the time when we can do fun projects
        with our classmates!Our IPC units this year were All about me,Human body,Rainforest,
        Edo,and right now,the Olympics.We have learned so much vocabulary during 
        all our reasearch and we have all had a lot of fun.My favorite part
        of this year was being together with my friends to work together.
        I think I made this clear,but IPC was definitely one of my favorite
        subjects this year.

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <br>
    
    
    <p>The stories that we have enjoyed together are fantastic.I have to say,
        Mr.Le Guen has good taste when it comes to choosing good books.
        The books we read for our IPC units are;Samira and the skeletons for our
        IPC unit on our Human body,One day in the tropical rainforest for our 
        IPC unit the Rainforest,The old man mad about drawing for our
        IPC unit on Edo,and A gruesome greek myth with a happy ending for
        our IPC unit the Olympics.
        Even though we spent most of our time reading books about IPC, we did
        spend some time reading IPC non-related books that are both chapter books
        and picture books.
        Starting with picture books we read; The word collector, A few books by 
        Shinsuke Yoshitake including It might be an apple and Can I build 
        another me?,and The Golden Rule.
        The chapter books we read were;Amber Brown and Fantastic Mr.Fox.

    <h2>Math</h2>
    
    
    <p>In Math we covered a number of different units.Some of them new and some
        of them a recap of what we did before.Our topics that we did this year are;
        Multiplication, Division, Fractions (Decimals),Elapsed time, and Geometry.
        How we learned this year were mainly work sheets but we also had a few games to memorize 
        our multiplication tables and to have fun with fractions!Lots of people's favorite 
        subject is math and I believe it is because of how fun it can be.

    <h2>Writing</h2>
 

    <p>This year we wrote in many different styles and ways. We did some poem writing and
       some non-fiction writing for our IPC projects and fiction writing for our monthly
       writing.
       Our first poem we did together was "What would I be without a skeleton?"
       This was based on our IPC project on the human body.Then we started to work on Edo and we
       started to learn about haiku.We learned all about writing and I have enjoyed this 
       writing time all throughout the year.
