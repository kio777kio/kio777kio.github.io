<h1>My classroom, 3 purple</h1>
<br>

<div class="3p"> 
    <p>This year I have felt very lucky that I got to attend school for most of the year!
    During this year, I have felt worried sometimes. Maybe even terrified about how
    COVID might pull us apart and that maybe the last year with my great friends 
    would be the worst one yet. Luckily this was one of the best years ever! The 
    projects with my friends and teachers were fantastic and I believe that you
    would think that too. 
</p></div>

<h1>My classmates</h1>
<br>


<p>My classmates this year have encouraged me, helped me, and let me be myself.
    Yes, sometimes we have problems and I can feel all alone but my true friends
    always helped me get back up.During the school year in the classroom, they 
    helped me when I was having problems on my worksheets and when we had to work as a 
    team to do the project!As I mentioned earlier, the big projects were one of 
    the highlights of my year.</p>

<h1>The new students</h1>
<br>


<p>Having new students in 3P was one of the greatest parts of the year!
    We got Lucia and Zora in the beggining of the year. The moment
    they stepped into our classroom I knew that because of them we'd have an 
    interesting year,and I was right!!Having Zora and Lucia in our class makes
    our class so much more interesting then having a regular class.Our class
    can be quite loud but that loudness makes our friendship.
    Anna came in the middle of the year.Another student was also supposed to come 
    but she never showed up!I understand that she could'nt come because of 
    COVID but I was still quite dissapointed.Anna caught up with our
    Rainforest unit quite fast like Mr.Le Guen has said,and I think that 
    was amazing.I probably could'nt have finished anything with the late
    start Anna had had.
